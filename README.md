# segment-tree
DS that allows answering range queries over an array effectively, while still being flexible enough to allow modifying the array. This includes finding the sum of consecutive array elements a[l…r], or finding the minimum element in a such a range in O(logn) time. Between answering such queries the Segment Tree allows modifying the array by replacing one element, or even change the elements of a whole subsegment (e.g. assigning all elements a[l…r] to any value, or adding a value to all element in the subsegment).
